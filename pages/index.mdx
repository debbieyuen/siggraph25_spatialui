Spatial user interfaces (UI) and graphics are important components in three-dimensional environments found across many applications including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), and video games. As spatial computing enters the mainstream through products like the Apple Vision Pro, the design of intuitive, accessible 3D user interfaces (UI) is critical. Creating UI in spatial applications that interact naturally with the physical and digital worlds requires engineering and design considerations that go beyond traditional 2D interfaces.

This course challenges participants to rethink 3D UI design to enhance spatial experiences through intuitive and predictive interfaces with machine learning to explore an ambitiously comprehensive look at the challenges of developing UI/UX for the Apple Vision Pro. We begin with core design principles of 2D and 3D UI before diving deeper into 3D UI, focusing on how depth perception, spatial awareness, and natural gestures work together to create cohesive user experiences and interactions. Then, we apply these concepts to introduce individuals to programming and designing with CoreML and SwiftUI. Finally, we examine how leveraging AI/ML enables personalization for individual needs, a key in revolutionizing the accessibility and future of spatial UI.
