Thank you for joining our session, hosted by Debbie Yuen (USC) and Mark Ramos (NYU), and made possible through the generosity of NVIDIA, Apple, and SIGGRAPH! In this session, we focus on spatial user interfaces (UI) and graphics for three-dimensional environments. We explore designing intuitive and predictive 3D user interfaces with machine learning. Before we get started with our lecture and hands-on lab, we would love to provide a brief introduction on the Apple Vision Pro, what you can expect from this course, and the materials you will need. 

## Getting Started with the Apple Vision Pro
We have a total of 25 Apple Vision Pro placed on every other computer. Please gather together in groups to collaborate on the programming exercises and take turns sharing the Apple Vision Pro. For the best experience with the Apple Vision Pro, we recommend remaining seated and removing jewelry that may come in contact with the Apple Vision Pro while being worn. If you are experiencing any discomfort, please alert the instructors immediately. 

To read more about how to adjust the fit of the Apple Vision Pro, complete setup, and navigate applications, please visit [*Getting started with the Apple Vision Pro*](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/get-started-with-apple-vision-pro-tan489cfe222/visionos).

When the Apple Vision Pro is not in use, please place it carefully back in its case along with its associated cords and materials. Before leaving the lab session, we ask to double-check that the Apple Vision Pro is stored properly and its charging cables are attached.
