### Step 2: Photos Tab in Toolbar
On the Apple Vision Pros, you will find the toolbar on the left. In this window, we have 3 toolbars including the left toolbar, bottom toolbar, and the top ornament. Select the `Photos` Tab to open up the tab.

### Step 3: Choose Photo
Once you are in the tab, you may try choosing a photo of your choice to classify. By default we are using Apple's built-in Vision Framework with `VNClassifyImageRequest()`.
