## Hands-On-Lab

Let's get started with the hands-on component! 
Next to each Apple Vision Pro, you will find a crayon box. If you do not have a crayon box or would like one, you may find extras at the front of the classroom. Or, raise your hand and one of the instructors will support.

With the Mac, the Apple Vision Pro, and the crayon box, we will take you through an artistic journey while learning exploring the space of predictive UI or UI Understanding. 

### Setting Up

* **Step 1:** Put on the Apple Vision Pro and fit it. The Apple Vision Pros do not need passwords. For the best experience, please remain seated and adjust the straps to fit accordingly.

* **Step 2:** On the Macbooks, navigate to **XCode** and open the **Swiggly** Xcode project at `Documents/squiggly`. Make sure the project compiles correctly by selecting the **Run** button in the header.

* **Step 3:** On the Apple Vision Pro, find the **Squiggly App** and open it. You should see a welcome screen with a 3D model of SIGGRAPH's mascot, Squiggly, animated. 

Now that your Apple Vision Pro and the XCode project is set up, lets talk about the development and design of the app before diving into its contents. 

### Machine Learning
In the Squiggly app, machine learning was integrated in a number of different ways. 

### User Interface 
Entering into the Squiggly app, you will immediately see a welcome screen. This screen in visionOS is called a Window.
